# ProcureMind AI 🚀
**Intelligent Sourcing & RFP Management System**

ProcureMind AI is a full-stack MERN application designed to automate the manual, error-prone process of Request for Proposal (RFP) management. It uses AI to bridge the gap between unstructured human requirements and structured procurement data.



## 🌟 Key Features
- **NLP Requirement Parsing**: Converts messy user input (e.g., "I need 15 desks") into structured JSON schemas.
- **Automated Vendor Dispatch**: Integrated system to select and notify verified vendors from a MongoDB database.
- **Bid Extraction Simulation**: A simulated webhook that demonstrates how incoming vendor emails are parsed into a comparison matrix.
- **AI-Driven Decision Support**: Automatically evaluates bids based on price, warranty, and delivery timelines to provide a "Best Value" recommendation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **AI Logic**: Integration-ready for OpenAI/Gemini (currently utilizing a high-fidelity mock controller for stable demonstrations).
